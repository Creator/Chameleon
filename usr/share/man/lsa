LSA - List All Files - LSA

NAME
  lsa - list all files in a directory

SYNOPSIS
  lsa [-h|-v] [file]...

DESCRIPTION

  lsa is the preffered utility for viewing files
  in the file system. It differentiates between
  directories, files and read-only entries.

  Depending on the type of entry being listed,
  the color of the entry changes. files have a
  green color, directories have a blue color and
  read-only entries have a red color.

  lsa does not have any required arguments. The
  arguments you may pass represent a list of
  directories to list. If no arguments are passed,
  the current working directory as represented by
  shell.dir() is used.

  Additionally, a single character representing
  the type of entry is displayed. It may be a d or
  an f, if the entry is a directory or a file,
  respectively. The file of the entry is also
  displayed, in bytes.

OVERVIEW
  The command line option -h prints out the usage
  of the lsa command, as determined by the
  standard Chameleon usage format.

  The command line option -v prints out the
  version of lsa.
