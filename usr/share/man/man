MAN(1) - Manual Viewing Utility - MAN(1)

NAME
  man - an interface to the local manual pages

SYNOPSIS
  man [-h|-v] [section] page

DESCRIPTION
  man is the system's manual viewer. Each page
  argument passed to man is normally the name of a
  program, utility or function. The manual page of
  the first argument is then passed and displayed.

  The default is looking just in section one,
  but this can be overriden by setting the
  environment variable MAN_SEARCH_PATH.

  A manual page consists of several sections.

  Conventional  section  names  include  NAME,
  SYNOPSIS,  CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION,  OPTIONS,
  EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT,
  FILES, VERSIONS, CONFORMING TO,  NOTES,  BUGS,
  EXAMPLE,  AUTHORS,  and SEE ALSO.

  The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS
  section and can be used as a guide in other
  sections.

  normal text      type exactly as shown
  <text>           replace with the appropriate
  arguments.

  [-abc]           any or all arguments within [ ]
  are optional.
  -a|-b            options delimited by | cannot
  be used together.

  argument ...     argument is repeatable.
  [expression...]  entire expression within [ ] is
  repeatable.

EXAMPLES

  man <ls>
    Display manual text for ls.

  man <1> <ls>
    Display manual text for ls in section one.

OVERVIEW
  Many  options are available to man in order to
  give as much flexibility as possible to the
  user.  Changes can be made to the search path,
  section  order,  output  processor,  and  other
  behaviors and operations detailed below.

  These options are passed as environment
  variables. They are prefixed with MAN_, and
  specify things such as the order of sections,
  colors for using, and tabulation options.
